### Scaled sound pressure level prediction using supervised learning

### About the data:

This problem has the following inputs:
1. Frequency, in Hertzs.
2. Angle of attack, in degrees.
3. Chord length, in meters.
4. Free-stream velocity, in meters per second.
5. Suction side displacement thickness, in meters.

The only output is:
6. Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels. 

### About the correlation:
The correlation coefficient ranges from â€“1 to 1. When it is close to 1, it means that there is a strong positive correlation for eg(sound pressure tends to go up when Free-stream velocity increases) and this is opposite for negative correlation with respect to Scaled sound pressure level.

Thank you!
